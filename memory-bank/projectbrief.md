# Project Brief

## Project Goals

To generate comprehensive documentation for the MainWP ecosystem using phpDocumentor 3.7.1 and automate the process with GitHub Actions. Additionally, to provide well-organized hooks documentation that makes it easier for developers to discover and use the appropriate hooks for their extensions.

## Core Requirements

1. Configure phpDocumentor to generate documentation from two source repositories.
2. Create GitHub Actions workflows to automatically update documentation when source code changes.
3. Deploy the generated documentation to GitHub Pages.
4. Implement robust error handling and logging.
5. Place generated documentation in designated subdirectories, keeping the main directory available for a custom home page and additional developer resources.
6. Generate comprehensive hooks documentation using Pronamic WP Documentor.
7. Categorize hooks into functional categories for better organization and discoverability.

## Project Scope

1. Set up phpDocumentor configuration to exclude specific dependencies.
2. Create GitHub Actions workflows to monitor source repositories.
3. Automate pulling of latest code, documentation generation, and deployment.
4. Organize documentation output in appropriate subdirectories.
5. Preserve the main directory for custom index page and additional developer resources.
6. Provide step-by-step instructions for implementation and maintenance.
7. Document error handling and debugging strategies.
8. Implement hooks documentation generation using Pronamic WP Documentor.
9. Create a Python script for categorizing hooks into functional categories.
10. Develop bash scripts for automating the hooks documentation process.
11. Integrate hooks documentation into the main documentation structure.
12. Transform source code references in hooks documentation into direct links to the GitHub repository.
