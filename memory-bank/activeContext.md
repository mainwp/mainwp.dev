## Next Steps

1. **Implement Beginner-Friendly Content Improvements**:
   - Create a dedicated "Getting Started" landing page with a step-by-step numbered process
   - Implement a visual progress tracker showing the learning journey
   - Add difficulty level indicators (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) to all guides
   - Create "What You'll Learn" and "Prerequisites Checklist" sections for each guide
   - Add more visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts) to help conceptual understanding
   - Break long content into more digestible chunks with clear subheadings
   - Ensure all markdown files stay under 800 lines when possible, splitting longer guides into logical parts
   - Review and update any remaining instances of old terminology

2. **Implement Hook Firing Order Documentation**:
   - Document the general sequence of when major MainWP hooks fire
   - Provide guidance on choosing appropriate priorities
   - Identify hook dependency chains
   - Document common pitfalls related to hook timing
   - Create a simple visual timeline of hook execution for beginners

3. **Improve Discoverability and Navigation**:
   - Modify index.html to include prominent links to developer guides
   - Ensure consistent navigation between all documentation types
   - Set up GitHub Pages for hosting the generated documentation
   - Enhance navigation to guide first-time developers through a logical learning path
   - Create a more intuitive structure for beginners to follow

4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error handling and logging for the automated process.

5. **Test GitHub Actions Workflows**: Test the GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they work correctly.

6. **Verify GitHub Links**: Ensure all GitHub repository links in the hooks documentation are working correctly and pointing to the right files and line numbers.

7. **Evaluate Documentation Format Options**: Assess the benefits of adding Markdown-based API documentation alongside the existing RST format, potentially using a dual documentation approach with separate directories.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Beginner-Friendly Documentation Strategy**: Implementing a more accessible approach for new developers:
   - Creating a clearer "first steps" pathway with fewer initial choices
   - Adding visual progress indicators to show learning journey
   - Using consistent difficulty level indicators across all guides
   - Implementing more visual aids for conceptual understanding
   - Breaking complex topics into smaller, more digestible chunks

2. **Code Quality Standards**: Establishing consistent standards for all code examples:
   - Following WordPress coding standards for formatting and naming conventions
   - Implementing proper security practices (validation, sanitization, capability checks)
   - Enhancing error handling with contextual messages and logging
   - Using defensive programming techniques throughout examples
   - Ensuring consistent commenting style with DocBlocks

3. **File Size Management**: Keeping documentation files maintainable:
   - Targeting markdown files under 800 lines when possible
   - Using a "Part 1/Part 2" approach for complex topics
   - Creating dedicated "Quick Start" companion files for experienced developers
   - Ensuring logical content splitting with clear navigation between related parts

4. **Terminology Update**: Adopted new terminology to distinguish between different types of MainWP add-ons:
   - **Add-on(s)**: Umbrella term for all add-ons
   - **Extension**: An add-on that works WITHOUT a third-party plugin or API
   - **Integration**: An add-on that works WITH a third-party plugin or API

2. **Layered Documentation Strategy**: Implementing a progressive disclosure approach with:
   - Quick Start sections for experienced developers
   - Detailed explanations for new developers
   - Well-organized reference material for all developers

3. **Content Design Principles**:
   - Scannable content with clear headings and structure
   - Progressive complexity from basic to advanced topics
   - Practical, real-world code examples with copy-paste snippets
   - Visual signposting to distinguish content types
   - Contextual cross-references for non-linear exploration

4. **Part-Time Developer Focus**: Optimizing documentation for developers who are creating MainWP add-ons as a side project:
   - Quick start guides that respect time constraints
   - Clear pathways for both Extension and Integration development
   - Ready-to-use code snippets that can be adapted
   - Focused, practical implementation guidance
   - Troubleshooting help for common issues

3. **Source Code Verification**: Ensuring documentation accuracy by cross-referencing with:
   - Current mainwp/mainwp and mainwp/mainwp-child repositories
   - Generated PHPDocumentor output
   - Hooks implementation in source code

4. **Documentation Completeness**: The quality of generated documentation depends on the completeness of PHPDoc comments in the source code. Some areas may need manual enhancement.

5. **Error Handling Strategy**: Need to decide on the best approach for handling and reporting errors in the documentation generation process.

6. **Update Frequency**: Determining how often the documentation should be regenerated - on every commit, daily, or on specific events.

7. **Performance Optimization**: The documentation generation process takes about 20-30 seconds for each repository. This is acceptable for local development but may need optimization for automated workflows.

8. **Diagram Generation**: The class diagram generation is failing due to missing PlantUML binary. Need to decide whether to install PlantUML or disable diagram generation.

9. **File Name Length Issues**: Some files in the Child repository have very long names that cause warnings. May need to implement a solution to handle these cases.

10. **Documentation Format Strategy**: Evaluated options between RST (current) and Markdown (available since phpDocumentor v3.6.0). Decided that RST provides superior structural information for API documentation, while Markdown would be better for narrative documentation. Implementing a dual approach with separate directories rather than a hybrid cross-linked system.

11. **Developer Guides Reference Strategy**: Implementing an optimal reference strategy for developer guides that links to API docs for formal definitions, GitHub for implementation examples, and other guides for conceptual relationships.
