# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

1. **Documentation Generation Testing**: Testing the documentation generation process with the MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories.

2. **Configuration Refinement**: Refining phpDocumentor configuration files to address issues and optimize output.

3. **Custom Content Development**: Enhancing the custom home page and navigation for the documentation.

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow Design**: Planning the automated workflows that will monitor source repositories and trigger documentation updates.

5. **Error Handling Implementation**: Developing robust error handling and logging for the documentation generation process.

## Recent Changes

1. **Repository Integration**: Cloned the MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories into the sources directory.

2. **phpDocumentor Configuration Fix**: Fixed the phpDocumentor configuration to correctly locate dependencies by modifying the reflection.yaml file.

3. **Guides Feature Adjustment**: Disabled the guides feature in phpDocumentor configuration as it was causing errors and the source repositories don't have guides documentation.

4. **Documentation Generation Success**: Successfully generated documentation for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories.

5. **Custom Home Page**: Created a custom home page (index.html) with navigation to the generated documentation.

6. **Directory Structure Verification**: Confirmed the directory structure is working correctly with source-code/dashboard and source-code/child for the generated documentation.

7. **Hooks Documentation Implementation**: Created a system for generating and categorizing hooks documentation using Pronamic WP Documentor and a custom Python script.

8. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflows for automating the documentation generation and deployment process.

9. **Functional Categorization**: Organized hooks into developer-friendly functional categories like Site Management, Updates & Maintenance, Content Management, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up GitHub Pages**: Configure GitHub Pages for hosting the generated documentation.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error handling and logging for the automated process.

3. **Test GitHub Actions Workflows**: Test the GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they work correctly.

4. **Develop Additional Documentation Sections**: Plan and implement REST API documentation sections.

5. **Optimize Documentation Generation**: Address warnings and errors in the documentation generation process, such as the PlantUML diagram generation and file name length issues.

6. **Create Implementation and Maintenance Documentation**: Provide step-by-step instructions for implementation and maintenance of the documentation system.

7. **Explore Custom Templates**: Investigate custom phpDocumentor templates for better integration with the MainWP brand.

8. **Refine Hooks Categorization**: Review and refine the automatic categorization of hooks to ensure they are properly organized.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Path Configuration**: Resolved issues with phpDocumentor's internal path configuration by modifying the reflection.yaml file to correctly locate dependencies.

2. **Documentation Completeness**: The quality of generated documentation depends on the completeness of PHPDoc comments in the source code. Some areas may need manual enhancement.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Need to decide on the best approach for handling and reporting errors in the documentation generation process.

4. **Update Frequency**: Determining how often the documentation should be regenerated - on every commit, daily, or on specific events.

5. **Performance Optimization**: The documentation generation process takes about 20-30 seconds for each repository. This is acceptable for local development but may need optimization for automated workflows.

6. **Diagram Generation**: The class diagram generation is failing due to missing PlantUML binary. Need to decide whether to install PlantUML or disable diagram generation.

7. **File Name Length Issues**: Some files in the Child repository have very long names that cause warnings. May need to implement a solution to handle these cases.
