# Product Context

## Problems it Solves

The MainWP.dev documentation project solves several key problems:

1. **Knowledge Gap**: Provides comprehensive documentation for developers working with MainWP, making it easier to understand and extend the platform.

2. **Fragmented Information**: Centralizes technical resources, code snippets, and API documentation in one accessible location.

3. **Documentation Currency**: Ensures documentation stays current with MainWP core changes through automated generation processes.

4. **Developer Onboarding**: Reduces the learning curve for new developers wanting to build extensions or customize MainWP.

5. **Maintenance Burden**: Automates the documentation generation process, reducing manual maintenance effort.

## How it Should Work

The documentation system should work through the following process:

1. **Source Monitoring**: GitHub Actions workflows monitor two source repositories for changes.

2. **Automated Generation**: When changes are detected, phpDocumentor automatically generates updated documentation.

3. **Organized Deployment**: Generated documentation is deployed to specific subdirectories on GitHub Pages.

4. **Custom Content**: The main directory remains available for custom content, including a homepage and additional developer resources.

5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging ensure the process runs smoothly and issues are easily identified.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide complete API documentation for all MainWP components.

2. **Intuitive Navigation**: Organize documentation in a logical structure that makes information easy to find.

3. **Code Examples**: Include practical code examples that demonstrate how to use APIs and hooks.

4. **Up-to-Date Information**: Ensure documentation reflects the latest MainWP releases and changes.

5. **Developer Focus**: Tailor content specifically for developers building extensions or customizing MainWP.

6. **Searchability**: Implement effective search functionality to quickly locate specific information.

7. **Cross-Referencing**: Link related documentation sections to provide context and additional information.
