## Current Status

The project has progressed significantly from the planning phase to a functional implementation with automation. The documentation generation process is working for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories, hooks documentation has been implemented with categorization and GitHub source links, and GitHub Actions workflows have been created for automation. The custom home page provides navigation to all documentation sections.

The current focus is on implementing comprehensive developer guides with a layered documentation approach that serves both new and experienced developers. These guides will complement the existing API reference documentation and hooks documentation, providing a complete documentation ecosystem for MainWP add-on developers (both extensions and integrations).

### Terminology Update Implementation

We've updated our terminology to distinguish between different types of MainWP add-ons:
- **Add-on(s)**: Umbrella term for all add-ons
- **Extension**: An add-on that works WITHOUT a third-party plugin or API
- **Integration**: An add-on that works WITH a third-party plugin or API

This terminology change has been implemented throughout the documentation to provide clear guidance for developers. The following changes have been made:

1. **Memory Bank Updates**:
   - Updated activeContext.md to include the new terminology and approach
   - Updated progress.md to reflect the new terminology and implementation tasks

2. **New Guides Created**:
   - guides/how-to/create-basic-integration.md: A comprehensive guide for creating integrations
   - guides/how-to/third-party-apis.md: A placeholder guide for working with third-party APIs
   - guides/best-practices/api-integration.md: A placeholder guide for API integration best practices
   - guides/reference/api-integration-patterns.md: A placeholder guide for common API integration patterns

3. **Updated Existing Guides**:
   - guides/index.md: Completely revised to explain the distinction between extensions and integrations
   - guides/concepts/extension-lifecycle.md: Renamed to "Add-on Development Lifecycle" and updated to include specific considerations for both extensions and integrations

4. **Decision Tree Implementation**:
   - Added a mermaid flowchart to guides/index.md to help developers determine whether to build an Extension or Integration

   - Added practical implementation guidance focused on results
   - Included common pitfalls and their solutions

6. **Link Structure Improvements**:
   - Updated all internal links to use relative paths instead of absolute paths
   - This improves portability and ensures links work correctly in different contexts

7. **Documentation Terminology Consistency Improvements**:
   - Enhanced guides/index.md to explicitly mention both standalone extensions and third-party integrations in the "Who These Guides Are For" section
   - Ensured developers immediately understand that the guides apply to both development paths
   - Replaced instances of "extension" with "add-on" in various places to be more inclusive of both types

8. **Integration-Specific Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Added a comprehensive new section to guides/how-to/actions-filters.md specifically about using hooks in third-party integrations
   - Included detailed examples for:
     * API communication patterns
     * Error handling for third-party APIs
     * Caching API responses to avoid rate limits
     * Securely handling API credentials
   - Updated the "Next Steps" section to include links to both extension and integration guides

     * Split content into three files:
       - social-media-integration.md: Core concepts, basic setup, and LinkedIn implementation
       - social-media-integration-part2.md: Advanced features, Bluesky implementation, and best practices
       - social-media-quick-start.md: Minimal setup instructions for experienced developers
     * Fixed duplication issues by creating a single, clean version
     * Reduced code examples to essential patterns rather than exhaustive implementations
     * Added more conceptual explanations with less code
     * Added cross-references between the three files
     * Added a prominent link to the quick start guide at the beginning of the main guide
     * Followed established documentation patterns from the WooCommerce guides

Progress: ~85% complete

## Documentation Format Strategy

After evaluating documentation format options for phpDocumentor:

1. **Current Approach**: Using ReStructuredText (RST) for API documentation output, which provides excellent support for class relationships, inheritance diagrams, and technical precision.

2. **Evaluated Options**:
   - Switching entirely to Markdown (available since phpDocumentor v3.6.0)
   - Implementing a hybrid cross-linked approach
   - Creating separate documentation sets in different formats

3. **Decision**: Maintain RST for API reference documentation while creating separate Markdown-based developer guides with conceptual documentation, how-to guides, and best practices.

4. **Reference Strategy for Developer Guides**:
   - Link to API docs (RST) for formal definitions of classes, methods, and properties
   - Link to GitHub for implementation examples and source code context
   - Cross-link between guides for conceptual relationships

5. **Layered Documentation Strategy**:
   - Quick Start sections for experienced developers
   - Detailed explanations for new developers
   - Well-organized reference material for all developers
   - Progressive disclosure approach to serve different experience levels
   - Optimized for part-time developers with time constraints

6. **Developer Persona Focus**:
   - Documentation optimized for developers creating MainWP add-ons as a side project
   - Quick start guides that respect time constraints
   - Clear pathways for both Extension and Integration development
   - Ready-to-use code snippets that can be adapted
   - Focused, practical implementation guidance
   - Troubleshooting help for common issues

## Known Issues

1. **Class Diagram Generation**: The class diagram generation is failing due to missing PlantUML binary. This is a non-critical issue but should be addressed for completeness.

2. **File Name Length Issues**: Some files in the Child repository have very long names that cause warnings during documentation generation.

3. **Documentation Completeness**: The quality of generated documentation depends on the completeness of PHPDoc comments in the source code. Some areas may need manual enhancement.

4. **Browser Navigation**: There may be issues with browser navigation when using file:// URLs. This will be resolved when deployed to GitHub Pages with proper HTTP URLs.

5. **Performance Considerations**: The documentation generation process takes about 20-30 seconds for each repository. This is acceptable for local development but may need optimization for automated workflows.
