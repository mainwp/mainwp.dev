# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Definition**: The project goals, core requirements, and scope have been clearly defined in the project brief.

2. **Memory Bank**: The memory bank structure has been created and populated with detailed information about the MainWP.dev documentation project.

3. **phpDocumentor Installation**: phpDocumentor 3.7.1 has been successfully installed via Composer.

4. **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is in place and working:
   - source-code/dashboard and source-code/child for generated documentation
   - phpdoc/ for configuration files
   - sources/ for MainWP source repositories

5. **Source Repository Integration**: The MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories have been successfully cloned into the sources directory.

6. **phpDocumentor Configuration**: Configuration files (dashboard.xml and child.xml) have been created and refined for both MainWP repositories.

7. **Documentation Generation**: Documentation has been successfully generated for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories.

8. **Custom Home Page**: A custom home page (index.html) has been created with navigation to the generated documentation.

9. **Project Documentation**: The README.md has been updated with project information, setup instructions, and directory structure details.

## What's Left to Build

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
   - Create workflow files for monitoring source repositories
   - Implement automation for pulling latest code
   - Set up documentation generation steps
   - Configure deployment to GitHub Pages

2. **GitHub Pages Setup**:
   - Configure GitHub Pages for the repository
   - Set up appropriate subdirectory structure
   - Implement custom domain if required

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement robust error handling in workflows
   - Set up logging for documentation generation process
   - Create notification system for errors

4. **Additional Documentation Types**:
   - REST API documentation
   - Hooks documentation
   - Developer guides and tutorials

5. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Address warnings and errors in the documentation generation process
   - Implement PlantUML for class diagrams
   - Optimize performance for large codebases

6. **Implementation and Maintenance Documentation**:
   - Create step-by-step instructions for implementation
   - Document maintenance procedures
   - Provide troubleshooting guides

## Current Status

The project has progressed from the planning phase to a functional implementation. The documentation generation process is working for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories, and the custom home page provides navigation to the generated documentation. The next phase involves implementing GitHub Actions workflows for automation and setting up GitHub Pages for hosting.

Progress: ~50% complete

## Known Issues

1. **Class Diagram Generation**: The class diagram generation is failing due to missing PlantUML binary. This is a non-critical issue but should be addressed for completeness.

2. **File Name Length Issues**: Some files in the Child repository have very long names that cause warnings during documentation generation.

3. **Documentation Completeness**: The quality of generated documentation depends on the completeness of PHPDoc comments in the source code. Some areas may need manual enhancement.

4. **Browser Navigation**: There may be issues with browser navigation when using file:// URLs. This will be resolved when deployed to GitHub Pages with proper HTTP URLs.

5. **Performance Considerations**: The documentation generation process takes about 20-30 seconds for each repository. This is acceptable for local development but may need optimization for automated workflows.
