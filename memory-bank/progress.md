# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Definition**: The project goals, core requirements, and scope have been clearly defined in the project brief.

2. **Memory Bank**: The memory bank structure has been created and populated with detailed information about the MainWP.dev documentation project.

3. **phpDocumentor Installation**: phpDocumentor 3.7.1 has been successfully installed via Composer.

4. **Directory Structure**: The directory structure is in place and working:
   - source-code/dashboard and source-code/child for generated documentation
   - phpdoc/ for configuration files
   - sources/ for MainWP source repositories
   - mainwp-hooks/ for hooks documentation
   - hooks-generator/ for hooks generation scripts

5. **Source Repository Integration**: The MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories have been successfully cloned into the sources directory.

6. **phpDocumentor Configuration**: Configuration files (dashboard.xml and child.xml) have been created and refined for both MainWP repositories.

7. **Documentation Generation**: Documentation has been successfully generated for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories.

8. **Custom Home Page**: A custom home page (index.html) has been created with navigation to the generated documentation.

9. **Project Documentation**: The README.md has been updated with project information, setup instructions, and directory structure details.

10. **Hooks Documentation**: A system for generating and categorizing hooks documentation has been implemented:
    - Using Pronamic WP Documentor to extract hooks from source code
    - Custom Python script for categorizing hooks by functionality
    - Developer-friendly organization with navigation and cross-references

11. **GitHub Actions Automation**: Workflows for automating the documentation generation and deployment process have been created:
    - Weekly scheduled runs
    - Manual trigger option
    - Version tag triggers
    - Source repository change detection

## What's Left to Build

1. **GitHub Pages Setup**:
   - Configure GitHub Pages for the repository
   - Set up appropriate subdirectory structure
   - Implement custom domain if required

2. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement robust error handling in workflows
   - Set up logging for documentation generation process
   - Create notification system for errors

3. **Additional Documentation Types**:
   - REST API documentation
   - Developer guides and tutorials

4. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Address warnings and errors in the documentation generation process
   - Implement PlantUML for class diagrams
   - Optimize performance for large codebases

5. **Implementation and Maintenance Documentation**:
   - Create step-by-step instructions for implementation
   - Document maintenance procedures
   - Provide troubleshooting guides

## Current Status

The project has progressed significantly from the planning phase to a functional implementation with automation. The documentation generation process is working for both MainWP Dashboard and Child repositories, hooks documentation has been implemented with categorization, and GitHub Actions workflows have been created for automation. The custom home page provides navigation to all documentation sections. The next phase involves setting up GitHub Pages for hosting and enhancing the documentation with additional sections.

Progress: ~75% complete

## Known Issues

1. **Class Diagram Generation**: The class diagram generation is failing due to missing PlantUML binary. This is a non-critical issue but should be addressed for completeness.

2. **File Name Length Issues**: Some files in the Child repository have very long names that cause warnings during documentation generation.

3. **Documentation Completeness**: The quality of generated documentation depends on the completeness of PHPDoc comments in the source code. Some areas may need manual enhancement.

4. **Browser Navigation**: There may be issues with browser navigation when using file:// URLs. This will be resolved when deployed to GitHub Pages with proper HTTP URLs.

5. **Performance Considerations**: The documentation generation process takes about 20-30 seconds for each repository. This is acceptable for local development but may need optimization for automated workflows.
