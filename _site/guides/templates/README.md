## How to Use These Templates

1. **Creating New Guides:**
   - Copy the appropriate template (usually `guide-template.md`)
   - Fill in the sections with your content
   - Ensure you include all required sections
   - Follow the formatting and structure of the template

2. **Updating Existing Guides:**
   - Compare the existing guide to the template
   - Add any missing sections
   - Restructure content to match the template format
   - Ensure code examples follow the standards in the code review checklist

3. **Maintaining Consistency:**
   - Use the terminology glossary to ensure consistent terminology
   - Follow the code review checklist for all code examples
   - Maintain the visual style defined in the documentation styles

## File Size Management

When creating or updating documentation:

- Target keeping markdown files under 800 lines when possible
- For longer guides, split content into logical parts:
  - Main guide (core concepts and implementation)
  - Part 2 (advanced techniques and edge cases)
  - Quick Start guide (condensed version for experienced developers)
- Ensure clear navigation between related parts
- Add cross-references between related guides

## Best Practices

1. **Beginner-Friendly Content:**
   - Start with the basics and gradually introduce more complex concepts
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Avoid jargon without explanation
   - Include visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts) to help conceptual understanding

2. **Code Examples:**
   - Follow WordPress coding standards
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add comments to explain complex logic
   - Ensure security best practices
   - Test all code examples

3. **Visual Structure:**
   - Use consistent headings and subheadings
   - Break long content into digestible chunks
   - Use lists and tables for structured information
   - Include difficulty level indicators

4. **Cross-Referencing:**
   - Link to related guides
   - Reference the API documentation for formal definitions
   - Link to GitHub for implementation examples
   - Link to the terminology glossary for technical terms
